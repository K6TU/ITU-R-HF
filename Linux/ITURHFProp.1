.SH NAME
ITURHFProp \- A software method for the prediction of the performance
of HF circuits based on ITU Recommendation P.533-13
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ITURHFProp [-csthv]
.I input-file
.B
.I [output-file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ITURHFProp
serves as an input and output data wrapper for the libp533.so library
used for the prediction of available frequencies, signal levels, and
reliability for analogue and digital-modulated HF systems.  The library
takes into account not only the signal-to-noise ratio but also the
expected time and frequency spreads of the channel. This program
calculates the HF path parameters in accordance with Recommendation
ITU-R P.533-13.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -c
CSV. Create RFC4180 CSV output.  The first line of the file is a
header with the same format as the subsequent record lines.  The header
contains names corresponding to the fields in the file and contains the
same number of fields as the records in the rest of the file.  This type of
file may be opened directly with the Python CVS module, supporting access to the
records as a dictionary.  Selecting this option also removes the header data.
.IP -s
Silent.  Suppress printing progress messages to std out while processing.
.IP -t
Strip the header.  Creates and output file with the header data removed.
.IP -h
Help.  Print a help message and exit.
.IP -v
Version. Print the version number of ITURHFProp and the P533 library and exit.
.IP input-file
Full path name of the input file. If no path is given the
current directory is assumed.
.IP output-file
Full path name of the output file. Note: Existing files will
be overwritten.  If no output file is indicated a default
output file, either a report or a path dump, will be created in
the report file directory specified by the
.I RptFilePath
parameter in the input file.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B ITURHFProp
does not make use of any environment variables.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
A return code of 0 indicates that the application has executed 
correctly.  In the event of an error, a return code and short
error message are printed to the console.  Refer to the README
provided with the application for a complete list of return codes
and their meaning.
